# Bot Interaction Details
@CheckerBotNfacbot on Telegram

The bot will guide the user through a series of questions. Below are the details of each part:

## Part 1: Ask for the Stage

The bot will first ask the user whether they are at "1 этап" or "2 этап". This step determines the stage of the process the user is in.

## Part 2: Ask for Needed Skills

Next, the bot will ask the user to list the needed skills for an applicant. This helps in defining the criteria for evaluating applicants.

## Part 3: Ask for Google Spreadsheet ID

Finally, the bot will ask for the Google Spreadsheet ID. This ID will be used to access a specific Google Sheet for further processing.
